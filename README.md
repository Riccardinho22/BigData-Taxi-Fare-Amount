# BigData-Taxi-Fare-Amount

## Description

This repository contains the code used to face the kaggle challenge - Taxi Fare Amount organized by Google Cloud & Coursera.
This is a regression task, the goal is to be able to create a model capable of predicting the taxi fare in New York.
We presented this project during the Big Data exam at Sapienza University of Rome

## Framework used:

The technologies used to tackle the task are:
The main framework used is Spark, for data management and for Machine Learning algorithms.

We have used Google Maps APIs (of which the code is not present), the Waze APIs (present code) and OpenStreetMap APIs.

We have used the Light Gradient Boosting Machine Regressor as a model since the implementation of Microsoft Azure.
